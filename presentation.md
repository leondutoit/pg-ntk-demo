# Outline

* Motivation: taking data ownership seriously
* Features for users, administrators, and developers
* For users: ownership, insight and consent-based usage
* For administrators: fine-grained access control, audit information
* For developers: a rich REST API, with a built-in authorization model

# Taking data ownership seriously

* [the GDPR](https://eugdpr.org/the-regulation/)
    * increased focus on data privacy and protection
    * right to access
    * right to be forgotten
    * data portability
    * consent-based data usage
    * increased demand for audit information
* surveilance capitalism
    * "you (and your data) are the product"
    * building applications to fight this trend
